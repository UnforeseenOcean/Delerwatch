# Delerwatch / Pisswatch
(BEFORE USING, READ THE DISCLAIMER AND EULA ON THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE)

A surprise for cheaters - This is disguised as a cheating program.


## WTF?
Yes, I know what you're thinking. "Why hate Overwatch? It's a great game so far!"
But that's not the thing I am focusing on, so get that out of your head for now.
I don't hate it. I just happened to see Overwatch releasing today here so people are more likely to have a file named Overwatch on their computer, so I chose that.
(Not to mention since I don't have that game I don't have to worry about losing access to the game :wink: )

## WTF is this for?
It is for demonstration purpose only. This unmodified script does not cause any damage (well, except your eardrums...) but beware of modified version.
This is for Windows platform only, and I can't be arsed enough to build a WINE compatible version.
This uses AutoHotkey and other components like Batch and VBS. Yeah, curse me if you want.

## your like 10yr old kid lol u h8 ovrwatch cuz u dnt hav it
Scram off. :fu:
