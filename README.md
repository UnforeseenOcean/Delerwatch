# Delerwatch
Annoying test program which plays audio and moves windows around if a file named Overwatch is found.

You're supposed to run delerw.bat.

## WTF?
Yes, I know what you're thinking. "Why hate Overwatch? It's a great game so far!"
But that's not the thing I am focusing on, so get that out of your head for now.
I don't hate it. I just happened to see Overwatch releasing today here so people are more likely to have a file named Overwatch on their computer, so I chose that.

## WTF is this for?
It is for demonstration purpose only. This unmodified script does not cause any damage (well, except your eardrums...) but beware of modified version.
This is for Windows platform only, and I can't be arsed enough to build a WINE compatible version.
This uses AutoHotkey and other components like Batch and VBS. Yeah, curse me if you want.

## your like 10yr old kid lol
Scram off.
